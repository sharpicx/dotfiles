## Prologue
This dotfiles is based in Indonesia and made by me. I did this because i need to backup all of my dotshits to keep off reconfiguration. I don't want to get crash or something which is where i have to do is setting up the configuration again. i just need to download the dots from this repo and store it step by step like a pro. and feel free for you to use it. idfc about copy paste or wot. because as you need to know, in this world everything is about ATM (Amati Tiru Modifikasi) it stands for (In English mode) Observe, Copy, Modification.

## Some trouble
* ### Display Manager
  This one is just reminder-like for me, about a small issue: <https://github.com/manilarome/lightdm-webkit2-theme-glorious/issues/32>.

* ### BlackArch Repo
  All you have to do is
  ```bash
  ~# rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg
  ~# pacman --init
  ~# pacman --populate archlinux blackarch
  ~# pacman --update --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
  ```
* If you wanna take a internet-freeing aka surving free and maybe watch a porn on the internet or something like illegal accesses, just replace [this file](https://github.com/bebasid/bebasid/blob/master/releases/hosts/) into your own, that's all.

* i will add more soon... if i had problem on my own.
